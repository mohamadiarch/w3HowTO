## css how to lessons 


1- flex-shrink ===> make children shrink, so if set to zero flex can not affect on children and scroll wil create 

2- in flex we have two axis: main axis and cross axis ===> in main axis we have no css property in flex so we should use margin-left: auto or margin-right:auto. 


3- if you use position fixed, you should use top, left and other.
